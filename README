AlphaZone4 API

This was my first ever Node.JS app. There are lot of terrible and a lot of interesting things inside!

This was built to replace a PHP implementation that wasn't holding up to the huge demand of the PlayStation Home community on update day.

A lot of sections are missing, so this is meant purely for anyone curious how some of AlphaZone4 worked.
